### CPSC 120


Lab 1


One of my favorite labs is lab 1 because it was the first time I had used a computer to code. Lab 1 helped me get familiar with basic commands. Overall it was a good first time experience and I enjoyed pushing the Hello world command.




Lab 5
Lab 5 is another one of my favorite labs because I enjoyed the complexity of the lab. It was one of the first where I ran into trouble pushing the lab. I enjoyed attempting to clear any errors that occurred.


Lab 6


Lab 6 was another one of my favorite labs because I found it interesting on how it relates to real world scenarios. I enjoyed utilizing pair programming with my partner. And I got a better understanding on how to write if statements.
